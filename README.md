# SimpleFreqs

A package for making simple and attractive frequency tables.

## Installation

```

# Install SimpleFreqs from CRAN (coming soon...)
# install.packages("SimpleFreqs")

# install from GitHub using remotes:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MartinLBarron/SimpleFreqs")

```
I hope the package will soon be available via CranSome functions I'm working on for creating basic summary statistics in R and displaying them in a nice way.
