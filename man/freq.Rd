\title{Caclulate frequencies of variable}
\usage{
freq(df, ..., plot = T, sort = T, na.rm = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe (You can also pass this program a single variable and it will silently transform it to a dataframe)}

\item{...}{a variable or variables in associated dataframe. If you pass no variables, freq will be run on all variables in dataframe}

\item{plot}{if TRUE (default) prints bar chart of results.  If FALSE, no chart.}

\item{sort}{If TRUE (default), sort output in descending order of n. If FALSE, sort output in ascending order of levels}

\item{na.rm}{if FALSE (default) NAs are included in frequency list.  If TRUE, NA are removed (but reported seperately)}
}
\value{
dataframe containing frequencies. Optionally prints frequency table and plots frequency
}
\description{
\code{freq} prints a frequency table for each variable passed to it.
}
\details{
freq


This function prints a frequency table for variables passed to it.  In
order to fit within the tidyverse, it takes as its first argument a dataframe
and returns the frequency table as a dataframe. See ]code{freqMd} for version
appropriate for easy markdown printing.
